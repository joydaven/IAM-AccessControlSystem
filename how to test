Step-by-Step Testing Guide
1. Start the Application
Apply to objective.tx...
Run
2. Open Your Web Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
3. Login with Admin Account
You'll see a login page. Use these credentials:
Username: admin
Email: joydaven@gmail.com
Password: admin123
4. Explore the Dashboard
After login, you'll land on the dashboard where you can:
‚úÖ View your current permissions
‚úÖ See permission statistics
‚úÖ Test permission simulation
‚úÖ Access quick navigation to different modules
5. Test Different Features

Go to the "Test Permissions" section on the dashboard
Select a user (admin), module (Users), and action (read)
Click "Test Permission" - should show ‚úÖ access granted
üë• User Management
Click "Users" in the sidebar
You should see the admin user listed
Try the "Add User" button (if you have create permissions)
üõ°Ô∏è Access Control Testing
Try accessing different modules from the sidebar
Admin should have access to all: Users, Groups, Roles, Modules, Permissions
üîê Authentication Testing
Click the logout button (top right)
Try accessing http://localhost:3000/users directly
Should redirect you to login (protected route)
6. Test Registration
On login page, click "Don't have an account? Sign up"
Register a new user:
Username: testuser
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
After registration, you'll be logged in but have no permissions
Try accessing Users page - should show "Access Denied"
7. Backend API Testing
You can also test the API directly:
Health Check
Visit: http://localhost:5000/api/health
Should return: {"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","service":"IAM Access Control System"}
Test API Endpoints (using browser or Postman)
# Get API info
GET http://localhost:5000/

# Login (POST request - use Postman/curl)
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123"
}

Apply to objective.tx...
Run
8. Browser Developer Tools Testing
Open DevTools (F12)
Network Tab: See API calls being made
Application Tab: Check localStorage for JWT token
Console Tab: Look for any JavaScript errors
9. Responsive Design Testing
Resize browser window - interface should adapt
Mobile view (DevTools device simulation)
Sidebar should collapse on mobile with hamburger menu
10. Permission Workflow Testing
As admin, you can test the full IAM workflow:
Create a new group (e.g., "Managers")
Create a new role (e.g., "User Viewer")
Assign read permission on Users module to the role
Assign the role to the group
Add a user to the group
Test that user's permissions via simulation
